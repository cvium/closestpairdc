Divide and Conquer implementation of the Closest Pair Problem in Java


This implementation requires the external library [ProGAL](http://www.diku.dk/~rfonseca/ProGAL/) for the visualisation. The code can be rewritten to use Java's own Point class etc.

It was used in my bachelor thesis "Kinetic Data Structures and the Closest Pair Problem"
